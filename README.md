# Updated Portfolio with React

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange)

## Description

Now that I've learned React, I went back and updated my portfolio to run with React instead of HTML and Bootstrap. It still uses Boostrap, but specifically the package built for React. I also incorporated packages for Font Awesome.
